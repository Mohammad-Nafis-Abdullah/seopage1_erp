          <p>Sometimes, project managers or sales people just add a milestone in an old project for upsales/cross sales. This happens especially for smaller amounts like 20-100 usd where creating a new deal won't make much sense. This field will show how many new milestones were added on older projects. For example, if 3 milestones were added under 2 old projects in the assign cycle i.e. 16th June-15th July, the count will be 3 here.</p>
