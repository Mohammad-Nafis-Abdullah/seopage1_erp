                                <p>Here, we are terming the first part of the cycle as “Assign cycle” (June 16-July 15) and
                                    the 2nd part of the cycle as “Release cycle” (June 16-July 30). Here are the
                                    considerations here: A. Since the release cycle is 45 days, there is a overlap of 15
                                    days between 2 cycles release cycles. For example, for June-Jule and July August cycle,
                                    the release cycles are June 16-July 30 and July 16-August 30th respectively. So here, we
                                    have an overlap of 15 days July 16-July 30th. Now, there can be a confusion like if a
                                    payment gets released in these 15 days, which cycle should it be counted in?</p>
                                <p>*Any project that started in the assign cycle of June-July or before and money released
                                    between July 16-July 30, should be counted in June-July release cycle.</p>
                                <p>*Any project that started in the July-August cycle i.e. July 16th-15th August and the
                                    money released between July 16-July 30, should be counted in July-August cycle.</p>
