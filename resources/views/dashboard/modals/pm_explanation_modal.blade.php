                                Here, we are terming the first part of the cycle as “Assign cycle” (June 16-July 15) and the 2nd part of the cycle as “Release cycle” (June 16-July 30). Here are the considerations here: A. Since the release cycle is 45 days, there is a overlap of 15 days between 2 cycles release cycles. For example, for June-Jule and July August cycle, the release cycles are June 16-July 30 and July 16-August 30th respectively. So here, we have an overlap of 15 days July 16-July 30th. Now, there can be a confusion like if a payment gets released in these 15 days, which cycle should it be counted in?
                            </p>
                            <p>*Any project that started in the assign cycle of June-July or before and money released between July 16-July 30, should be counted in June-July release cycle.</p>
                            <p>*Any project that started in the July-August cycle i.e. July 16th-15th August and the money released between July 16-July 30, should be counted in July-August cycle.</p>
