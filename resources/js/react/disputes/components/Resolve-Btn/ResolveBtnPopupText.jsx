The project managers will have a tendency to blame clients for whatever revisions they will have. Reject as many as those claims as you realistically can. Only hold clients responsible if its clearly evident in all the aspects. Holding clients responsible in bulk wont help our cause, instead comment how they could make sure the client couldnt give such revisions citing such reasons after delivery. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">2. Holding 2 persons responsible partially is something we kept arrangement in our system but this is not something we prefer to choose in bulk. Only use this if it&rsquo;s an absolute necessity. For example, if someone is 90% responsible, hold him responsible fully. In other words, try not to use this feature to best of your ability as this will make the responsible person feel someone else also has been accused after all his mitakes and he will be encouraged to continue doing such things in the future. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">3. Be neutral when resolving the disputes. There can be conflict of interests specially when resolving the dispute between sales team and other parties. Try staying neural so there is no complain. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">4. The objective of these disputes is to keep pressure on on various parties so they remain careful while they work and submit solid work which will have zero/minimal revisions. So it&rsquo;s better to close/resolve these dispute with as less meetings/comments exchanges as you can. In the dispute inner page, we have kept arrangements for every information that you may need when resolving a dispute. However, its ideal that the verdict is solid and go to any extent to make that happen. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">5. Be smart and make sure you don&rsquo;t get convinced by someone trying to fool/outsmart you and have the verdict in their favor by bringing in various nonsensical logics in the table. All of us often experience such things when handling employees. If this can&rsquo;t be ensured, some employees with relatively low performance will keep having higher performance scores. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">6. For any unique case that you are not sure of a solution or may have adverse affect if the verdict is given against the persons you think are responsible, consult with the management instead of making an unsure decision. </span></p></body></html>`
